use union to fetch from more than one table
number of column in both output should be same also data type should be same to make union
takes column name from first result/
it removes dups from output to avoid use  is faster --> union all
never use cross join between related tables
order of croos joint doesn't matters table1 cross join table2 = table2 cross join table1
